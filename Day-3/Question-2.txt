Question:
	Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, write a function to return the k most frequent elements in any order. The elements in the result should appear in descending order of their frequency in nums.

Example:

Input 1:
nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

Output 1:
[1, 2]

Input 2:
nums = [1], k = 1

Output 2:
[1]

Constraints:
	1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁵
	-10⁴ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁴
	k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
	It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
