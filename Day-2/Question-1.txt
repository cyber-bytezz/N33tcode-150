Problem Statement:
	You are given two strings s and t. Your task is to determine if t is an anagram of s. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different.
	You should return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Constraints:
	1 ≤ s.length, t.length ≤ 5 * 10⁴
	s and t consist of lowercase English letters only.
